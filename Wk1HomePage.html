        <p> I'm grateful to still be here and to not have lost anyone to COVID. There are so many people that made this year more bearable, 
            like everyone that helped create and test the vaccine, every service worker that put on a mask and worked in a pandemic so I 
            could feed my family, every artist distracting us from our grief, and the healthcare heroes that worked ridiculously long shifts 
            trying to save lives. Here is a website sharing some positives that came out of my year. I committed to reading a book a week, 
            recommitted to taking better care of myself, and connected through a mutual love of corny memes. Click on the tabs above to 
            explore each topic. I hope you found a sunny clearing in this storm, too.  
        </p>

        <p>Also, I need a break from these kids. If you'd like to babysit, please complete the information fields below and I will contact 
            you immediately. Thank you!</p>
